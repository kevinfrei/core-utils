# js-freik-utils

This is a collection of random crap I've used over the past few years
to get various stuff going well on Node and/or React. I'm moving them
into a public repo, as I'm trying to build something in it's own repo,
instead of in my same private repo I've been using for years.

Maybe I'd document some of this stuff eventually. Know that it will all
probably change. Some of it is pretty crufty...
